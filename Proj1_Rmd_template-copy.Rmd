## BETA DISTRIBUTION 

### Discrete or Continuous?

Is it a discrete or continuous distribution? Continuous distribution


### Assumptions of the Beta Distribution

The variable represents a proportion or probability between 0 and 1.

The shape parameters α > 0 and β > 0.

Observations (if used to estimate α and β) are independent.

There’s a fixed underlying probability whose uncertainty we’re modeling.

### Real World Example

1. Election Probabilities – When people have different beliefs about the chance of a candidate or party winning, a Beta distribution can summarize these opinions and reflect both the most likely outcome and the uncertainty.

2. A/B Testing / Conversion Rates – In marketing or web design, if a fraction of users take a desired action (like clicking a button), the Beta distribution models the probability of success and captures the uncertainty due to the sample size.

3. Medical Trials – When testing a new treatment, the Beta distribution can represent the probability that a patient responds positively, especially useful when only a limited number of trial outcomes are observed.

### Support

What are all possible values of the distribution? (also called the support of the distribution) 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 [0 & 1]
**Explanation:** The Beta distribution is ideal for modeling quantities that are bounded between 0 and 1, such as probabilities, proportions, or percentages. For example, it can represent the probability of success in a **Bernoulli** trial or the proportion of a population with a certain characteristic.

### Parameters

What are the parameters of the distribution? Provide alpha and beta

* the R names of the parameters :
- shape1 = $\alpha$ (alpha)
- shape2 =  $\beta$ (beta) 

* verbal names for the parameters 
- alpha is the first shape parameter 
-beta is the second shape parameter 

* notation for the parameters
Beta(α,β)

### Parameter space

For each parameter, what is its range of possible values? (also called the parameter space)
For the Beta distribution(α,β): 
\alpha > 0 α>0 (parameter space: (0, ∞))

\beta > 0 β>0 (parameter space: (0, ∞))

### Mean and variance

Express the following as a function of the parameter(s):

* The mean of the distribution
mean = alpha/ alpha + beta

* The variance of the distribution
variance = alpha * beta / ((alpha + beta)^2 * (alpha + beta + 1))

### Plot of probability density function

Plot the probability density function of the distributions at 4 different sets of parameter values.

```{r, warning=FALSE}

# Different parameter combinations
params <- list(
  c(1,1),   # Uniform distribution (flat)
  c(0.5,0.5), # U-shaped
  c(2,2),     # symmetric, bell-shaped
  c(2,5),      # skewed right
  c(5, 2)
)

x <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000)
df <- data.frame()  # initialize properly

for (p in params) {
  alpha <- p[1]; beta <- p[2]
  df <- rbind(df, data.frame(
    x = x,
    density = dbeta(x, alpha, beta),
    alpha = alpha,
    beta = beta
  ))
}

```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x, density, color = paste("α=", alpha, ", β=", beta))) +
  geom_line(size=1) +
  labs(title = "Beta Distribution PDFs",
       color = "Parameters") +
  theme_minimal()

```


### How does the distribution change with the parameters?

Describe how the distribution depends on changes in the parameters, including changes in the center, spread, and shape of the distribution. 

**Uniform case:** α = β = 1 → Uniform (0,1) Every value between 0 and 1 is equally likely.

**Skewness (who’s bigger, α or β?)**

α > β → distribution skewed left (mass near 1).

α < β → distribution skewed right (mass near 0).

α = β → distribution is symmetric about 0.5.

**Concavity (are α and β less than or greater than 1?)**

α, β < 1 → U-shaped (high at the ends, low in the middle).

α, β > 1 → bell-shaped (peaked around the mean).

α = β = 1 → flat (uniform).

**Concentration (variance control)**

If you increase both α and β while keeping their ratio the same, the mean stays fixed but the variance shrinks.

**Example:**

(α=2, β=2) → symmetric, moderate variance.

(α=20, β=20) → still symmetric around 0.5, but much more concentrated around 0.5.
Larger values of α and β (while keeping ratio constant) → distribution gets more concentrated around the mean (lower variance).


### Distribution-specific questions and hints

You need only answer the questions about the distribution to which your group is assigned.

#### Beta

Hint: You should not worry about the parameter `ncp`. Leave it set at the default value of 0.

* For which values of the parameters is the density function concave up, concave down, and flat?

*Concave Up:* When 𝛼 < 1 and 𝛽 < 1, producing a U-shaped PDF with peaks at 𝑥 = 0 and 𝑥 = 1. Example: 𝛼 = 0.5, 𝛽 = 0.5.

*Concave Down:* When 𝛼 > 1 and 𝛽 > 1, resulting in a bell-shaped PDF. Example: 𝛼 = 2, 𝛽 = 2 (symmetric bell).

*Flat:* When 𝛼 = 1 and 𝛽 = 1, giving the Uniform(0,1) distribution with constant density 𝑓(𝑥) = 1 Skewed (mixed concavity): When one parameter is less than 1 and the other greater than 1.
Example: 𝛼 = 2, 𝛽 = 5 (skewed right). .


- **Skewed (mixed concavity):** When one parameter is less than $1$ and the other greater than $1$.  
  Example: $\alpha = 2, \beta = 5$ (skewed right).
